# SmartBuildingTracker
This is Real-time monitoring of building occupancy, WiFi-based indoor positioning system which have multi-purpose applications.
##Applications
_1. This can be used for crowd tracking and analysis for a smooth transition of the workforce in office spaces after pandemic struck world_
_2. This can be used with online restaurant booking apps as an additional feature to monitor and output crowd densities in restraunts_
_3. This can be used as analytics for business busy hour tracking and help monetize the business better_
_4. Search and rescue operations in case of disasters would be better with help of this app_
_5. This could be used for checking up abnormal patterns in cases of future protests_

##How did we build this?
Frontend- 
Backend- Mac address of access points and signal strength of devices connected to them and find the distance. This was one approach to finding the number of devices connected to the network and in the building. The second one was finding the IP address and with that checking how many devices are there at the geolocation. The third thing is using media pipes and running them through surveillance systems and counting the number of people present.


##Future aspects
We believe that this could be deployed at various public interest places. The future technological aspect is that we could simply integrate the camera code and partner up as an extension to various surveillance system technologies.
Also for analytics, we think we could run the data through machine running models to check for abnormal patterns and analytics for tracking it improving the businesses

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges at first as this was the first time everyone in our team was working on something like this. There was extreme learning and understanding of how the device addresses, access points, and geolocation works.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of &  What we learned
We are proud that we have done so much in a limited amount of time and learned something with a different technology background. We learned about Internet protocols and how the internet works in general. Also, there was a good amount of learning in wifi technology.

## What's next for DevBuilt
We plan on working with this more and completing the prototype to product and market it as a service or API.

##Product and Business side
Needless to say, this has great incentives for offices, government, and business. Once made this can be turned into a monetized model.
